# portfolio-page

## The Module 2 Challenge is to create a portfolio with advanced CSS skills we have acquired from the second module. The purpose of this project is to practice our advanced CSS skills as well as build upon the HTML skills we learned in the previous module to get better at our base skills before moving to JavaScript. This includes things like making sure the web page is formated for different deives, and that it is accessible.
